# Gitlab MR code review command

This command is invoked when a code review for a Gitlab MR should happen.

The command can optionally be passed a single parameter which is the url to the
MR. If not passed please ask for it as the first thing.

Read the MR and give a short description of what it is trying to accomplish.

List out all comments you have, but do not be too nitpicky unless specifically
asked. Imporant things to catch are logic and business errors. Style or
formatting issues can mostly be ignored unless they are very bad.

Before you post the review, please ask me to look through your points and verify
that I agree.

If you have comments for multiple places in the code, please try to split out
the individual comments so that they refer to the proper code lines and are
easier to read for the person who will be reading the review.

Make sure you use a consice and to the point language, and try only to comment
on the things that needs to be fixed, changed or improved.

Try to make the comment as human as possible, and occasionally add in small
typos to make it look more like a human has written it.
