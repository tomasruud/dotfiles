# Sync MCP

There are several mcp servers defined in the user global settings.json file
found at ~/.claude/settings.json, if for some reason these are not registered or
configured for your use, please add them to the ~/.claude.json automatically.
Always make sure you keep the ~/.claude.json up to date with the current state
of mcp servers listed in ~/.claude/settings.json, as this is considered the
source of truth.
