# Dear Claude

## Motivation

If you ever feel down or demotivated, try asking the motivator agent for a small
pep talk.

## Working with Golang projects

Please make sure you always use the gopls MCP whenever you are working on a go
project. Refer to @go.md for further instructions.

## Code Review

When working on code changes, use the CodeRabbit CLI to get feedback and iterate
whenever you are working on a task. Use this feedback to improve and fix code.
Start CodeRabbit in the background using: `coderabbit --prompt-only` when
beginning any code work, and check with the output periodically during
development and especially after completing features or fixes. Fix all
identified issues immediately before moving to the next task. Repeat the review
cycle until CodeRabbit reports no issues.
